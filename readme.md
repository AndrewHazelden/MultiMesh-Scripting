# MultiMesh Scripting v1.1 #
Released 2017-02-14  
by Andrew Hazelden  

## Overview ##
![This is a snapshot of a sample MultiMesh Scripting Conversion.](multimesh-process.png)

The MultiMesh Scripting tool simplifies the process of using meshlabserver on Windows. The scripts provide an easy way to batch covert mesh formats, and creates a standardized method for applying a MeshLab MLX filter script to a folder of laser scan or photogrammetry reconstructed geometry files.

## Download ##

The MultiMesh Scripting .BAT scripts are open source programs that are available as a free download.

This script uses meshlabserver to drive the conversions. To get a copy of meshlabserver you need to download the latest copy of MeshLab (which is free) from VCG:  
[http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/ "http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/")


## Installation ##

For the MultiMesh Scripting software to work it has to be expanded and moved to the folder:  
> C:\multiMeshScripting


The MultiMesh Scripting scripts expect MeshLab & meshlabserver to be located at:
> C:\Program Files\VCG\MeshLab\meshlabserver.exe

You can edit the two MultiMeshScripting .bat scripts if you installed meshlab to another location on your hard disk.

## Batch Script Notes ##

![MultiMesh Scripting Folder](project_folder.png)

I created the following .bat scripts to show what is possible:

**runMLXScript.bat**  
Processes the mesh files in the input folder using meshlabserver and a user defined MLX script

**convertMeshes.bat**  
Converts the meshes in the input folder using a meshlabserver with a user defined output format.


### Changing Input & Output File Names ###

To change the name of the input and output files you can edit the .bat scripts using a plain text editor.

Input Mesh File variables  

> @set inputFolder=input  
> rem Note: You can choose a specific mesh format for input or  
> rem use an asterix for all files in the input meshes folder  
> rem @set inputMeshFormat=obj  
> @set inputMeshFormat=ply  
> rem @set inputMeshFormat=*  



Output Mesh File variables  

> @set outputFolder=output  
> @set outputMeshFormat=obj  
> rem @set outputMeshFormat=ply  
> rem Note: If you use the PLY output format it is saved as a BINARY PLY file  
> rem @set outputMeshFormat=u3d  


MLX script file variables  

> rem the MLX scripts are stored in the C:\multiMeshScripting\scripts folder  
> @set mlxScriptFile=simple_script.mlx  
> @set mlxScriptFolder=scripts
